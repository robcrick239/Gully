Plantain - 

-Scientific name - Plantago major
-Origins - Plantains are believed to have originated in Southeast Asia.
-Health Benefits - Plantains are a good source of vitamin C, and including them as part of a varied diet can help support the immune system.

Potassium is essential for the normal functioning of the heart, nerves, and muscles. It helps metabolize carbs and synthesize protein.

With good levels of vitamin C, they can also support immune function. Likewise, their vitamin B6 content may reduce cardiovascular risk and improve mood.

They’re packed with magnesium, which is known to increase the release of tryptophan and serotonin in the body, which can help people relax and sleep.

Plantains are high in iron, which is essential for the production of red blood cells.

-Fun Facts

Many modern plantains are hybrids derived from the cross of two wild species, the Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

 Since they fruit all year round, plantains are a reliable all-season staple food, particularly in developing countries with inadequate food storage, preservation and transportation technologies.

Plantains are sometimes dried and ground into flour. In southern India, dried plantain powder is mixed with a little bit of fennel seed powder and boiled in milk or water to make baby food.
