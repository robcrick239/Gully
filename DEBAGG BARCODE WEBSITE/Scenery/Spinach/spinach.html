		<h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
		<p>
			Some fun facts about spinach are:

            <p>
                Medieval artists extracted green pigment from spinach to use as ink or paint.
             </p>
             <p>
                The creator of the comic strip character, Popeye, E.C. Segar was a vegetarian 
                and as a way of promoting the benefits of vegetables, he boosted his character’s strength with a known iron-rich food. Popeye has been portrayed since 1931.
                As a result of this show, U.S. spinach growers credited
                Popeye with a 33% increase in domestic spinach consumption – a welcome boost to an industry during the depression era.
